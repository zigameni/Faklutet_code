Given are the pointer declarations through which the registers of two input/output devices can be accessed: 

```cpp
typedef volatile unsigned int REG; 
REG* io1Ctrl =...; // Device 1 control register 
REG* io1Status =...; // Device 1 status register 
REG* io1Data =...; // Device 1 data register 
REG* io2Ctrl =...; // Device 2 control register 
REG* io2Status =...; // Device 2 status register 
REG* io2Data =...; // Device 2 data register 
```

In the control registers, the lowest bit is the Start bit, which initiates the device, and in the status registers, the lowest bit is the Ready bit. All registers are the size of one machine word (type unsigned int).

It is necessary to write a function transfer that first performs the input of a block of data of a given size from the first device using polling, then outputs that same read block of data to the second device using interrupts, and returns control to the caller only when both transfers are completed.

### Solution
    Write a function transfer that first performs the input of a block of data of a given size from the first device using polling. 

```cpp

static REG* ioPtr = 0;
static int ioCount = O;
static int ioCompleted = 0;

void transfer(int count) {
    REG* buffer = new REG[count];

    // I/O first, transfer via polling, using busy wait, when the status register is ready we transfer. 
    ioPtr = buffer;
    ioCount = count;
    *io1Ctrl = 1; // Start I/O device;
    while(ioCount > 0) {
        while(!(*io1Status&1)) // busy wait
        *ioPtr++ = *io1Data;
        ioCount--;
    }
    *io1Ctrl = 0; // stop I/o 1


    // I/O 2: Using interrupt
    ioPtr = buffer; // where the data starts. 
    ioCount = count; // the size of the transfer
    ioCompledted = 0; /// this will eb changed in our interrupt rutine, to signafy completion. 

    *io2Ctrl = 1; // start i/O device. 

    while(!ioCompleted);
    delete [] buffer;
}


// interurpt rutine
interrupt void io2Interrupt() {
    *io2Data = *ioPtr++;
    if(--ioCount == 0) {
        ioComplted = 1;
        *io2Ctrl = 0; 
    }
}


```
