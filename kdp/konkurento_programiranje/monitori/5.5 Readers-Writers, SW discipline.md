# Readers-Writers Problem using SW discipline
    This monitor ensures that writers get preference when there's competition between readers and writers.

```cpp

    int cntW = 0;     // Number of writers currently writing
    cond rq, wq;      // Condition variables for readers and writers queues

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Monitor `RW_SW`**:
   - The monitor encapsulates the shared state and synchronization primitives for the Readers-Writers problem.
   - `cntR` and `cntW` keep track of the number of readers and writers currently accessing the resource.
   - `rq` and `wq` are condition variables for readers and writers respectively.

2. **Method `startRead()`**:
   - A reader must wait if there is an active writer (`cntW > 0`) or if writers are waiting (`wq.queue()`).
   - If the reader has to wait, it calls `rq.wait()`.
   - Once allowed to read, `cntR` is incremented.
   - If other readers are waiting, the next one is signaled (`rq.signal()`).

3. **Method `endRead()`**:
   - Decreases the reader count (`cntR`).
   - If no more readers are reading (`cntR == 0`) and writers are waiting, a writer is signaled (`wq.signal()`).

4. **Method `startWrite()`**:
   - A writer must wait if there are active readers (`cntR > 0`) or active writers (`cntW > 0`).
   - If the writer has to wait, it calls `wq.wait()`.
   - Once allowed to write, `cntW` is incremented.

5. **Method `endWrite()`**:
   - Decreases the writer count (`cntW`).
   - If there are readers waiting, the next reader is signaled (`rq.signal()`).
   - If no readers are waiting but writers are, the next writer is signaled (`wq.signal()`).

6. **Function `reader()`**:
   - Simulates reader behavior in an infinite loop.
   - Each reader calls `startRead()` before reading and `endRead()` after reading.

7. **Function `writer()`**:
   - Simulates writer behavior in an infinite loop.
   - Each writer calls `startWrite()` before writing and `endWrite()` after writing.

### Summary:

This implementation ensures that writers get preference when there's competition between readers and writers. Readers can proceed if no writer is active or waiting. Writers can proceed if no readers or writers are active. This helps prevent writer starvation while allowing multiple readers to access the resource concurrently when there are no writers.
