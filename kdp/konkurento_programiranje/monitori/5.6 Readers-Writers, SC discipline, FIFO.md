    int cntW = 0;           // Number of writers currently writing (not used in this implementation)

        // If there are readers reading or it's not this writer's turn
        if (cntR > 0 || myTicket / 2 != next) {
            q.wait(myTicket); // Writer waits

// Reader function

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Monitor `RW_SC_Fifo`**:
   - Manages the synchronization of readers and writers using a ticketing system to ensure FIFO order and SC discipline.

2. **Variables**:
   - `cntR`: Number of readers currently reading.
   - `cntW`: Number of writers currently writing (not utilized in this implementation).
   - `ticket`: Global ticket counter to assign unique ticket numbers to readers and writers.
   - `next`: The next ticket number that should be served.
   - `q`: Condition variable to manage the queue of waiting threads.

3. **Method `startRead()`**:
   - Assigns an even ticket number to the reader (`2 * (ticket++)`).
   - Checks if it's the reader's turn (`myTicket / 2 != next`), and if not, the reader waits (`q.wait(myTicket)`).
   - Increments the reader count (`cntR++`) and the next ticket number (`next++`).
   - Signals the next reader in the queue if there are threads waiting and the next thread is a reader.

4. **Method `endRead()`**:
   - Decrements the reader count (`cntR--`).
   - If no readers are reading and there are threads waiting, it signals the next thread.

5. **Method `startWrite()`**:
   - Assigns an odd ticket number to the writer (`2 * (ticket++) + 1`).
   - Checks if there are readers currently reading or if it's not the writer's turn, and if so, the writer waits (`q.wait(myTicket)`).

6. **Method `endWrite()`**:
   - Increments the next ticket number (`next++`).
   - Signals the next thread in the queue if there are threads waiting.

7. **Function `reader()`**:
   - Simulates reader behavior in an infinite loop.
   - Each reader calls `startRead()` before reading and `endRead()` after reading.

8. **Function `writer()`**:
   - Simulates writer behavior in an infinite loop.
   - Each writer calls `startWrite()` before writing and `endWrite()` after writing.

### Summary:

This implementation of the Readers-Writers problem uses a FIFO order with SC discipline. Readers and writers are assigned ticket numbers to ensure they are served in the order they arrive. Readers get even ticket numbers, while writers get odd ticket numbers. This helps manage the queue and ensures that threads are served in the correct order, preventing starvation and maintaining fairness.
