### Original System Overview

The original system uses a disk cache to store blocks of data from the disk, which helps speed up data access by reducing the need to repeatedly read from the slower disk. Here's a breakdown of how this system is organized and operates:

1. **Data Structures:**
   - `diskCache`: This is a two-dimensional array where each row represents a block of data from the disk. The size of each block is `BLKSIZE` bytes.
   - `diskCacheMap`: This is a one-dimensional array where each entry corresponds to an entry in `diskCache` and stores the block number of the data currently in that cache slot. If an entry in `diskCacheMap` is `0`, it indicates that the corresponding slot in `diskCache` is empty.
   - `diskCacheCursor`: This integer keeps track of which slot in the cache should be evicted next. The eviction strategy follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle.

2. **Operations:**
   - `diskRead(BlkNo block, Byte* toBuffer)`: Reads a block from the disk into the specified buffer.
   - `diskWrite(BlkNo block, Byte* fromBuffer)`: Writes the contents of the specified buffer to a block on the disk.

3. **Function:**
   - `getDiskBlock(BlkNo blk)`: This function attempts to fetch the requested block from the cache. If the block is not already in the cache, it reads the block from the disk into the cache, potentially evicting another block if the cache is full.

### Original Function Implementation

The original `getDiskBlock` function operates as follows:

1. **Search for the Block in Cache:**
   - The function iterates through the `diskCacheMap` array to see if the requested block (`blk`) is already in the cache.
   - If the block is found, it returns a pointer to the data in the `diskCache`.
   - If it encounters an empty slot (`diskCacheMap[i] == 0`), it breaks out of the loop because the block is not in the cache and there are still empty slots available.

2. **Evict and Load New Block:**
   - If the block was not found and the cache is full (`diskCacheMap[diskCacheCursor] != 0`), it writes the block currently at `diskCacheCursor` back to the disk using `diskWrite`.
   - It then reads the requested block from the disk into the cache slot pointed to by `diskCacheCursor` using `diskRead`.
   - It updates the `diskCacheMap` with the new block number and increments `diskCacheCursor` (wrapping around using modulo operation if necessary).

### Problem with the Original Implementation

The primary issue with the original implementation is that it performs a linear search through `diskCacheMap` to find a block, which can be inefficient if the cache is large. This linear search has a worst-case time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the cache.

### Improved Solution Using a Hash Table

To improve the efficiency, the solution involves using a hash table to organize `diskCacheMap`. This reduces the average lookup time to O(1) by using a hash function and handling collisions with open addressing.

### Modified Function Implementation

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the improved `getDiskBlock` function:

1. **Compute Hash Index:**
   - The hash index for the block number is calculated using `hash = blk % CACHESIZE`. This determines the initial position in the cache where the block should be stored or searched for.

2. **Search for the Block in Cache:**
   - Starting from the computed hash index, the function searches for the block in the cache using a linear probing method.
   - If the block is found (`diskCacheMap[cursor] == blk`), it returns a pointer to the data in `diskCache`.
   - If an empty slot is found (`diskCacheMap[cursor] == 0`), it breaks out of the loop, as this means the block is not in the cache and there are still empty slots available.

3. **Handle Full Cache:**
   - If the loop completes without finding an empty slot (indicating the cache is full and the block was not found), it resets `cursor` to the initial hash index.

4. **Evict and Load New Block:**
   - If the slot at `cursor` is not empty, it writes the block currently at `cursor` back to the disk using `diskWrite`.
   - It then reads the requested block from the disk into the cache slot pointed to by `cursor` using `diskRead`.
   - It updates `diskCacheMap` with the new block number and returns a pointer to the data in `diskCache`.

Here’s the modified `getDiskBlock` function:

```cpp
Byte* getDiskBlock (BlkNo blk) {
    // Compute the hash index
    int hash = blk % CACHESIZE;
    int cursor = hash;

    // Search for the requested block in the cache
    for (int i = 0; i < CACHESIZE; i++) {
        cursor = (hash + i) % CACHESIZE;
        if (diskCacheMap[cursor] == blk) return diskCache[cursor]; // Block found
        if (diskCacheMap[cursor] == 0) break; // Empty slot found, stop search
    }

    // If not found and cache is full, start at hash index again
    if (diskCacheMap[cursor] != 0) cursor = hash;

    // If there is a block to evict, write it to the disk
    if (diskCacheMap[cursor] != 0) {
        diskWrite(diskCacheMap[cursor], diskCache[cursor]);
    }

    // Load the requested block from disk into cache
    diskCacheMap[cursor] = blk;
    diskRead(blk, diskCache[cursor]);
    return diskCache[cursor];
}
```

### Detailed Operation of the Modified Function

1. **Initial Hash Calculation:**
   - For a requested block number `blk`, compute the initial hash index using `hash = blk % CACHESIZE`. This gives an index in the range of 0 to `CACHESIZE-1`.

2. **Search Using Linear Probing:**
   - Begin the search at the computed hash index.
   - Use a for-loop to probe the cache entries starting from the hash index. For each iteration, calculate the current index using `cursor = (hash + i) % CACHESIZE`.
   - If the block is found (`diskCacheMap[cursor] == blk`), return the pointer to the data in `diskCache`.
   - If an empty slot is found (`diskCacheMap[cursor] == 0`), break out of the loop. This indicates that the block is not in the cache, and there are empty slots available.

3. **Handling Full Cache:**
   - If the block was not found and the loop completes without finding an empty slot, it indicates that the cache is full. Set `cursor` back to the initial hash index.

4. **Eviction and Loading:**
   - If the slot at `cursor` is occupied (`diskCacheMap[cursor] != 0`), write the block currently at `cursor` back to the disk using `diskWrite`.
   - Read the requested block from the disk into the cache slot pointed to by `cursor` using `diskRead`.
   - Update `diskCacheMap` with the new block number and return a pointer to the data in `diskCache`.

### Benefits of the Hash Table Approach

- **Efficiency:** The use of a hash table allows for faster average lookup times, typically O(1), compared to the linear search approach.
- **Collision Handling:** Linear probing ensures that collisions are resolved by finding the next available slot in a circular manner, maintaining the efficiency of the lookup and insertion process.
- **FIFO Eviction:** The modified function still maintains the FIFO eviction strategy when the cache is full, ensuring older blocks are replaced first.

By reorganizing the cache as a hash table, the system significantly improves the efficiency of cache operations, reducing the time spent searching for blocks and managing cache entries.
