### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Monitor `AlarmClock`**:
   - Manages the timing and waking up of threads using a condition variable `sleep`.

2. **Variables**:
   - `now`: Keeps track of the current time.
   - `sleep`: Condition variable to manage threads that are waiting to wake up.

3. **Method `tick()`**:
   - Simulates the passage of time by incrementing `now`.
   - Checks if there are threads waiting (`sleep.queue()`) and if the thread with the earliest wake-up time should wake up (`sleep.min_rank() <= now`).
   - If both conditions are met, it signals the thread with the earliest wake-up time.

4. **Method `sleep(int n)`**:
   - Calculates the wake-up time as `now + n`.
   - If the current time is less than the wake-up time, it puts the thread to sleep by calling `sleep.wait(wake_up_time)`.
   - After waking up (or if it didn't need to sleep), it checks if there are threads waiting and if the thread with the earliest wake-up time should wake up. If so, it signals that thread.

### Summary:

This `AlarmClock` monitor uses the SW (Signal and Wait) discipline to manage the timing and waking up of threads. Threads can call `sleep(int n)` to sleep for a specified number of ticks. The `tick()` method simulates the passage of time, incrementing the `now` variable and signaling waiting threads when their wake-up time arrives. This ensures that threads wake up in the correct order based on the time they were supposed to wake up.
