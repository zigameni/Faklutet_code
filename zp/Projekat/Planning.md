### Step 1: Understand the Project Requirements
- [ ] **Task 1.1:** Carefully read the project assignment and attached documentation.
- [ ] **Task 1.2:** Identify and note down any unclear requirements or assumptions that need to be clarified.

### Step 2: Set Up the Development Environment
- [ ] **Task 2.1:** Install Python and necessary development tools.
- [ ] **Task 2.2:** Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) for collaborative work.
- [ ] **Task 2.3:** Install required Python libraries (e.g., rsa, cryptography).

### Step 3: Design the Application
- [ ] **Task 3.1:** Define the overall architecture of the application.
- [ ] **Task 3.2:** Design the graphical user interface (GUI) layout.
- [ ] **Task 3.3:** Plan the data structures for storing keys (public and private keyrings).

### Step 4: Implement Key Management Features
- [ ] **Task 4.1:** Implement functionality to generate new RSA key pairs.
- [ ] **Task 4.2:** Implement functionality to delete existing RSA key pairs.
- [ ] **Task 4.3:** Implement import and export functionality for keys in .pem format.
- [ ] **Task 4.4:** Implement a display for the public and private keyring with necessary information.

### Step 5: Implement Message Sending Functionality
- [ ] **Task 5.1:** Implement the GUI for composing a message.
- [ ] **Task 5.2:** Add options to encrypt the message, sign the message, compress the message, and convert data to radix-64 format.
- [ ] **Task 5.3:** Implement selection of private key for signing (using SHA-1 for hash).
- [ ] **Task 5.4:** Implement selection of public key for encrypting and the choice of symmetric algorithm (support at least two of TripleDES, AES128, Cast5, IDEA).
- [ ] **Task 5.5:** Create a file structure for sending the message with all necessary information.
- [ ] **Task 5.6:** Implement functionality to save the message file to the desired destination.

### Step 6: Implement Message Receiving Functionality
- [ ] **Task 6.1:** Implement the GUI for selecting a message file to receive.
- [ ] **Task 6.2:** Implement functionality to recognize packages and perform decryption and verification.
- [ ] **Task 6.3:** Display information about the success of signature verification and author details.
- [ ] **Task 6.4:** Implement functionality to save the original message to the desired destination.
- [ ] **Task 6.5:** Implement error handling for unsuccessful decryption or verification and display clear error messages.

### Step 7: Testing and Debugging
- [ ] **Task 7.1:** Write test cases for each functionality (key generation, import/export, message sending, message receiving).
- [ ] **Task 7.2:** Perform thorough testing of the application.
- [ ] **Task 7.3:** Debug any issues or errors found during testing.

### Step 8: Documentation and Preparation for Defense
- [ ] **Task 8.1:** Document the code and create a user manual.
- [ ] **Task 8.2:** Prepare for the oral defense by understanding the code and possible questions.
- [ ] **Task 8.3:** Review the project requirements and ensure all criteria are met.

### Step 9: Submission and Defense
- [ ] **Task 9.1:** Submit the project by the deadline.
- [ ] **Task 9.2:** Present and defend the project during the scheduled exam period.

### Additional Notes
