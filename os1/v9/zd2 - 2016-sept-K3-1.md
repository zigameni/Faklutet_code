Given a procedural interface to a `block-oriented` input device with `direct access`:

```cpp
extern const int BlockSize;
extern int BlockIOHandle;   // ID
long getSize(BlockIOHandle handle);
int readBlock(BlockIOHandle handle, long blockNo, char* addr);
```

The device is identified by a "handle" of type `BlockIOHandle`, and a block is `BlockSize` characters in size. The `getSize` operation returns the total size of the content (data) on the device (in characters), and the `readBlock` operation loads the block with the given number into a buffer at the given memory address and returns 0 on success. Both operations return a negative value in case of an error, including an attempt to read a block beyond the content size.

Using this interface, implement the following object-oriented interface for this device, which abstracts it into an input stream, i.e., a character-oriented input device with direct access:

```cpp
class IOStream {
public:
  IOStream(BlockIOHandle d);
  int seek(long offset);
  int getChar(char& c);
};
```

The `seek` operation sets the "cursor" position for reading to the given position (offset starting from the character at position 0), and the `getChar` operation reads the next character from the current cursor position into the output argument `c` and moves the cursor forward by one position. In case of any error, including moving the cursor beyond the content size or reading a character when the cursor has reached the end of the content, the operations should return a negative value, and zero in case of success.


### Solution

```cpp
class IOStream {
public:
    IOStream(BlockIOHandle d);
    int seek(long offset);
    int getChar(char& c);

protectd: 
    int loadBlock(); //loads blocks corresponding to the cursor. 
private:
    BlockIOHandle dev; // device
    char buffer[BlockSize]; 
    long curBlock, cursor;
};



int IOStream::loadBlock () {
    long blockNo = cursor/BlockSize;
    if (curBlock==blockNo) return 0;
    if (readBlock(dev,blockNo,buffer)<0)) {
        cursor = -1;
        return -1;
    } 
    curBlock = blockNo;
    return 0; 
}

int IOStream::seek (int offset) {
    cursor = offset;
    if (cursor<0 || cursor >= getSize(dev)) {
        cursor = -1;
        return -1;
    } 
    return 0;
}

int IOStream::getchar (char& c) {
    if (cursor<0 || cursor>=getSize(dev)) {
        cursor = -1;
        return -1;
    }
    
    if (loadBlock()<0) 
        return -1; 

    c = buffer[(cursor++)%BlockSize];
        return 0;
}


```
