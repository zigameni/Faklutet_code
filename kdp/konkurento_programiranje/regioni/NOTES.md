# Regioni

### Translation

#### Regions

Resource declaration of a certain type is done in the same way as the declaration of any other shared variable:

```pascal
res: shared type;
```

A conditional critical region is syntactically defined as follows (the `await` statement is optional, and if omitted, a regular critical region is obtained):

```pascal
region res do
begin
 ...
 [await(condition);]
 ...
end;
```

#### Regions

```pascal
region res
```
â†’ the calling process has exclusive access to the variable `res`.

If the variable `res` is a structure, it can be implicitly assumed that its field `field` within the region is accessed without explicitly mentioning the structure name:

```pascal
field := value; 
```
is equivalent to 

```pascal
res.field := value;
```

The condition in the `await` statement represents a Boolean expression that must be executed atomically and must not have side effects.
- If the condition is not met, the calling process is blocked and releases the region resource (relinquishes exclusive access) so that another process can access the region.

#### Regions

- If a process has exclusive access to multiple variables, it relinquishes only the last obtained access (retains exclusive access to other variables).
- The process that was blocked on the condition will be allowed to re-enter the region when the condition is met and no other process is currently accessing the region (no explicit condition checks or explicit waking up of a specific process).
- FIFO is not guaranteed.

### Pascal Code to C++ Conversion

If we have Pascal code for defining and working with regions, it can be converted to C++ in the following manner:

#### Pascal Code

```pascal
res: shared type;

region res do
begin
 ...
 await(condition);
 ...
end;
```

#### C++ Code

First, include necessary headers and define synchronization primitives.

```cpp
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>

std::mutex res_mutex;
std::condition_variable res_cv;
bool condition; // This should be defined and managed properly

void region_res() {
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(res_mutex);
    res_cv.wait(lock, [] { return condition; });

    // Critical section code goes here

    // Update condition as needed
    condition = false;

    // Notify other threads if condition might have changed
    res_cv.notify_all();
}
```

This C++ code uses `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable` to achieve similar functionality to the Pascal `region` and `await` constructs. The `region_res` function represents the critical section protected by the mutex and the condition variable. The condition should be properly managed to reflect the actual logic in your Pascal code.
