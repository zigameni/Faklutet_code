Implement the class `DoubleBuffer` completely, whose interface is given. This class implements a double buffer. The producer places characters into the buffer one by one by calling the `put()` operation; the character is placed into the current `"output"` buffer of two internal buffers of size `'size'` characters.

The consumer takes blocks of `'chunkSize'` characters from the current "input" buffer by calling the get() operation; the characters are copied into the caller's buffer pointed to by the argument 'buffer'. When both are done with their buffer, the buffers swap roles.

`The producer and consumer are concurrent threads` (they do not need to be implemented), while all necessary synchronization is within the `DoubleBuffer` class. Assume that the given buffer size in characters (constructor argument 'size') is an integer multiple of the given block size (constructor argument 'chunkSize'). Use semaphores for synchronization.


```cpp
class DoubleBuffer {
public:
	DoubleBuffer (int size, int chunkSize);
	void put (char);
	void get (char* buffer);
private: ... 
};

```

### SOlution 

```cpp

class DoubleBuffer {
public:
    DoubleBuffer (int size, int chunkSize);
    void put();
    void get(char* buffer);

private:
    Semaphore inputBufReady, outputBufReady;
    char* buffer[2];
    int size, chunk, head, tail, slots, item, inputBuf, outputBuf;
};

DoubleBuffer::DoubleBuffer (int sz, int cs): inputBufReady(1){
    
}




```
