# Blockchain Development Environment Setup

## Ethereum Blockchain Development

To set up the Ethereum blockchain development environment, we use the Ganache-CLI image from Docker Hub.

### Starting Ganache-CLI

First, start Docker Desktop and run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
docker run -p 8545:8545 trufflesuite/ganache-cli
```

`trufflesuite/ganache-cli` is pulled from Docker Hub.

### MyEtherWallet Setup

In the "etherwallet-v3.21.06" folder, there are files to access the MyEtherWallet website, which is used for blockchain interaction. Using the user interface is not necessary for this lab, as everything is done in code.

### Configuring Ethereum Node

1. Open the `index` page from the etherwallet folder.
2. Select the last option from the dropdown menu: **Add Custom Network/Node**.
3. In the popup window, enter a name (cannot contain underscores) and fill in the rest as shown in the image below:

![Custom Network/Node Configuration](placeholder)

After saving, to create a new EtherWallet, enter a password (does not need to be the same as the node name):

![EtherWallet Creation](placeholder)

Creating the password generates a JSON file with the private key, which should be saved on the computer for later interaction:

![Private Key JSON](placeholder)

You will also receive your private key, which should also be copied and saved:

![Private Key](placeholder)

### Viewing Wallet Info

The **View wallet info** option in the navbar allows you to see the status of your wallet:

- Choose **keystore/JSON file** and upload the file received during wallet creation.
- Enter the password you set (e.g., `vezbaBlockchain`) and click **unlock**.

You will see the following:

- Information about the wallet address (to receive ETH tokens).
- Balance (0 ETH).
- Transaction history, etc.

### Sending Offline Transactions

Using the **send offline** option, you can send from one account to another using your wallet.

## Code Explanation

### transactions.py

In this file, ETH is sent from our account to the first account in the free list (explained below):

- Install the `web3` library.
- Connect to the node created earlier in etherwallet using:

```python
web3 = Web3(HTTPProvider("http://127.0.0.1:8545"))
```

- Copy the Keystore file to `keys.json` and load its content into a dictionary:

```python
with open("keys.json", "r") as file:
    keys = json.loads(file.read())
```

#### Fetching Account Address

```python
address = web3.to_checksum_address(keys["address"])
```

This function checks if the Ethereum address is correctly formatted and returns a normalized version for safe transactions.

#### Decrypting Private Key

```python
private_key = Account.decrypt(keys, "iepblockchain").hex()
```

`iepblockchain` is the password set for the wallet during exercises (replace with `vezbaBlockchain`).

#### Fetching Account Balance

```python
web3.eth.get_balance(address)
```

#### Accessing Accounts

When the command `docker run -p 8545:8545 trufflesuite/ganache-cli` was run, a list of available accounts and their private keys was provided. To access one:

```python
to_account = web3.eth.accounts[0]
```

`accounts` is an array of available accounts (indexed from 0 to 9).

#### Transaction Details

```python
transaction = {
    "to": to_account,
    "value": 10000,
    "nonce": web3.eth.get_transaction_count(address),
    "gasPrice": 1
}
```

#### Estimating Gas

```python
gas_estimate = web3.eth.estimate_gas(transaction)
transaction["gas"] = gas_estimate
```

Gas is the unit for measuring the execution cost of operations or transactions on the Ethereum network.

#### Signing the Transaction

```python
signed_transaction = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(transaction, private_key)
```

The transaction is signed with the private key to ensure its security.

#### Sending the Transaction

```python
transaction_hash = web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_transaction.rawTransaction)
receipt = web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(transaction_hash)
```

The `send_raw_transaction` method sends the transaction in raw form to the network and returns a unique identifier for the transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. The program waits until the transaction is processed, and `receipt` contains the transaction details.

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are scripts on the blockchain that execute, verify, or enforce transactions without intermediaries. They are transparent, immutable, and decentralized as they run on platforms like Ethereum.

### Solidity

Solidity is the programming language for writing smart contracts.

### compile.ps1

This script contains commands to run a Docker image to compile Solidity contracts.

#### Script Content

```powershell
param([string]$file_path)
```

Indicates that this script runs with one parameter (`file_path`) used in the Docker run command to pass the file for compiling the smart contract.

#### Running in PowerShell

```sh
.\compile.ps1 "solidity/contract.sol"
```

#### Output Directory

Results are placed in the `sources/output` folder, representing the binary code Ethereum understands.

### Smart Contract Script: tokens.sol

Represents a contract for obtaining and using tokens.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.2;

contract Tokens {
    address payable owner;
    mapping(address => uint256) balances;

    constructor(address payable _owner) {
        owner = _owner;
    }

    function buyToken() external payable {
        owner.transfer(msg.value);
        balances[msg.sender] += 1;
    }

    function getToken(address customer) external view returns (uint256) {
        return balances[customer];
    }

    function spendToken(address customer) external {
        require(balances[customer] > 0, "Not enough tokens.");
        balances[customer] -= 1;
    }
}
```

### tokens.py

Reading binary files:

```python
bytecode = read_file("./solidity/output/Tokens.bin")
abi = read_file("./solidity/output/Tokens.abi")
contract = web3.eth.contract(bytecode=bytecode, abi=abi)
```

Using `compile.ps1`, the translated smart contract Tokens from `tokens.sol` is placed in the output folder.

#### Creating a Smart Contract Object

```python
transaction = contract.constructor(address).build_transaction({
    "from": address,
    "nonce": web3.eth.get_transaction_count(address),
    "gasPrice": 21000
})
```

#### Signing the Transaction_

```python
signed_transaction = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(transaction, private_key)
transaction_hash = web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_transaction.rawTransaction)
receipt = web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(transaction_hash)
```

#### Creating the Contract Instance

```python
contract = web3.eth.contract(address=receipt.contractAddress, abi=abi)
```

#### Calling Contract Function

```python
contract.functions.getToken(customer).call()
```

#### Generating a Transaction

```python
contract.functions.buyToken().transact({
    "from": customer,
    "value": web3.to_wei(1, "ether")
})
```

#### Handling Errors

```python
try:
    send_transaction(customer0_spend_tokens_transaction, customer0_private_key)
except ContractLogicError as error:
    print(error)
```

## family_wallet_simple.sol

### Modifier

```solidity
modifier only_family() {
    require(
        msg.sender == father || msg.sender == mother || msg.sender == child,
        "Only family members can access this account!"
    );
    _;
}
```

### Returning Multiple Values

```solidity
function get_request() external view only_family returns (uint256, Status, address) {
    return (request.amount, request.status, request.creator);
}
```

### family_wallet_simple.py

#### Function: create_and_initialize_account()

Generating a private key:

```python
private_key = "0x" + secrets.token_hex(32)
```

Creating an account from the private key:

```python
account = Account.from_key(private_key)
```

#### Creating Transactions for `deposit()` for Father, Mother, and Child

```python
father_deposit_transaction = contract.functions.deposit().build_transaction({
    "from": father_address,
    "value": DEPOSIT_AMOUNT,
    "nonce": web3.eth.get_transaction_count(father_address),
    "gasPrice": 1
})
send_transaction(father_deposit_transaction, father_private_key)
```

The `build_transaction` method is used to build the transaction object before sending it to the network.

## family_wallet_advanced.sol

### create_request Function

Creating a new Request object:

```solidity
Request memory request;
```

Adding the new Request object to the array:

```solidity
requests.push(request);
```

### Events

Events log actions or state changes in the contract:

```solidity
event NewRequest(uint32 index);
```

In the `create_request` function, emitting this event is used later in the `.py` file to track activities:

```solidity
emit NewRequest(count - 1);
```

### family_wallet_advanced.py

Similar to the simple wallet, with additional event handling:

#### get_request_index Function

Iterating through all events:

```python
def get_request_index(contract):
    for event in contract.events.NewRequest.create_filter(fromBlock="latest").get_all_entries():
        return event["args"]["index"]
    return 0
```

The function returns the index of the event if there

 is one, otherwise 0.

#### Custom Functions

Custom functions like `get_request_index` or others are used to handle more advanced wallet features and events.
